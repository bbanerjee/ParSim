\chapter{MPM Material Models}
In this chapter we discuss some general features of the MPM material
models.  Individual models are complex and are discussed in separate
chapters.  Notation and definitions that are used frequently are
also elaborated upon here.

\section{Notation and definitions}
A primary assumption made in many of the material models in Vaango is that
stresses and (moderate) strains can be additively decomposed into volumetric and deviatoric parts.

\subsection{Volumetric-deviatoric decomposition}
The volumetric-deviatoric decomposition of stress ($\Bsig$) is expressed as
\Beq
  \Bsig = p\BI + \BsT
\Eeq
where the mean stress ($p$) and the deviatoric stress ($\BsT$) are given by
\Beq
  p = \Third\Tr(\Bsig) = \Third\Bsig:\BI = \tfrac{1}{3}(\sigma_{11} + \sigma_{22} + \sigma_{33})
  \quad \Tand \quad
  \BsT = \Bsig - p\BI = 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
       \sigma_{11} - p & \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{13} \\
       \sigma_{12} & \sigma_{22} - p & \sigma_{23} \\
       \sigma_{13} & \sigma_{23} & \sigma_{33} - p
    \end{bmatrix} \,.
\Eeq

Similarly, the volumeric-deviatoric split of the strain ($\BVeps$) is expressed as
\Beq
  \BVeps = \Third \Veps_v \BI + \BVeps_s
\Eeq
where the volumetric strain ($\Veps_v$) and the deviatoric strain ($\BVeps_s$) are defined as
\Beq
  \Veps_v = \Tr(\BVeps) = \BVeps:\BI = \Veps_{11} + \Veps_{22} + \Veps_{33}
  \quad \Tand \quad
  \BVeps_s = \BVeps - \Third \Veps_v\BI = 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
       \Veps_{11} - \Third \Veps_v & \Veps_{12} & \Veps_{13} \\
       \Veps_{12} & \Veps_{22} - \Third \Veps_v & \Veps_{23} \\
       \Veps_{13} & \Veps_{23} & \Veps_{33} - \Third \Veps_v
    \end{bmatrix} \,.
\Eeq

\subsection{Stress invariants}
The principal invariants and principal deviatoric invariants of the stress are used in 
several models.  Frequently used invariants are:
\Beq
  \Bal
    I_1 & = \Tr(\Bsig) = \sigma_{11} + \sigma_{22} + \sigma_{33} \\
    I_2 & = \Half\left[\Tr(\Bsig)^2 - \Tr(\Bsig^2)\right]
          = \sigma_{11} \sigma_{22} + \sigma_{22} \sigma_{33} + \sigma_{33} \sigma_{11}
            -  (\sigma_{12}^2 + \sigma_{23}^2 + \sigma_{13}^2) \\
    I_3 & = \det(\Bsig)
          = \sigma_{11}\sigma_{22}\sigma_{33} + 2\sigma_{12}\sigma_{23}\sigma_{13}
            - \sigma_{12}^2 \sigma_{33} - \sigma_{23}^2 \sigma_{11}
            - \sigma_{13}^2 \sigma_{22} \\
    J_2 & = \Half \BsT:\BsT 
          = \tfrac{1}{6}\left[(\sigma_{11} - \sigma_{22})^2 + 
             (\sigma_{22} - \sigma_{33})^2 + (\sigma_{33} - \sigma_{11})^2\right] +
             (\sigma_{12}^2 + \sigma_{23}^2 + \sigma_{31}^2) \\
    J_3 & = \det(\BsT) = \tfrac{2}{27} I_1^3 - \Third I_1 I_2 + I_3
  \Eal
\Eeq
Alternatives to $I_1$, $J_2$ and $j_3$ are $p$, $q$, and $\theta$, defined as
\Beq
  p := \frac{1}{3} I_1~,~~ q := \sqrt{3 J_2}~,~~
  \cos3\theta := \left(\cfrac{r}{q}\right)^3 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{J_3}{J_2^{3/2}} ~,~~
  r^3 = \frac{27}{2} J_3\,.
\Eeq
A geometric accurate view of the stress state and yield surfaces is obtained if 
the isomorphic cylindrical coordinates $z$, $\rho$, and $\theta$ are used instead, where
\Beq
  z := \frac{I_1}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{3} p ~,~~
  \rho := \sqrt{2 J_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} q ~,~~
  \cos3\theta := \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{J_3}{J_2^{3/2}} \,.
\Eeq

\subsection{Effective stress and strain}
The effective stress and strain (sometimes also referred to as the shear stress and shear strain
in the code) are defined such that the product is equal to the plastic work done.  These
measures are strictly applicable only to $J_2$ plasticity models but have also been used elsewhere.

The effective stress is defined as
\Beq \label{eq:eff_stress}
  \sigma_\Teff = q = \sqrt{3J_2} = \sqrt{\tfrac{3}{2} \BsT:\BsT}
    = \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}\left[(\sigma_{11} - \sigma_{22})^2 + 
             (\sigma_{22} - \sigma_{33})^2 + (\sigma_{33} - \sigma_{11})^2\right] +
             3 (\sigma_{12}^2 + \sigma_{23}^2 + \sigma_{31}^2) } \,.
\Eeq

The effective strain is defined as
\Beq \label{eq:eff_strain}
  \Veps_\Teff = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3} \BVeps_s:\BVeps_s}
\Eeq
so that
\Beq
  \sigma_\Teff \Veps_\Teff = \sqrt{(\BsT:\BsT) (\BVeps_s:\BVeps_s)} \,.
\Eeq
From the definition of $\BVeps_s$ we see that
\Beq
  \Bal
  \BVeps_s:\BVeps_s & = \BVeps:\BVeps - \tfrac{2}{3} \Tr(\BVeps)\BI:\BVeps + \tfrac{1}{9}\left[\Tr(\BVeps)\right]^2 \BI:\BI
     = \BVeps:\BVeps - \tfrac{2}{3} \left[\Tr(\BVeps)\right]^2 + \tfrac{1}{3}\left[\Tr(\BVeps)\right]^2
     = \BVeps:\BVeps - \Third \left[\Tr(\BVeps)\right]^2 \\
     &= \Veps_{11}^2 + \Veps_{22}^2 + \Veps_{33}^2 + 2\Veps_{12}^2 + 2\Veps_{23}^2 + 2\Veps_{13}^2
       - \Third\left[ \Veps_{11}^2 + \Veps_{22}^2 + \Veps_{23}^2 + 2\Veps_{11}\Veps_{22} + 
       2\Veps_{22}\Veps_{33} + 2\Veps_{11}\Veps_{33} \right] \\
     &= \Third\left[(\Veps_{11} - \Veps_{22})^2 + (\Veps_{22} - \Veps_{33})^2 + (\Veps_{33} - \Veps_{11})^2 \right] + 2(\Veps_{12}^2 + \Veps_{23}^2 + \Veps_{13}^2)
  \Eal
\Eeq
Therefore,
\Beq
  \Veps_\Teff = \sqrt{
      \tfrac{2}{3}\left[\Third\left[(\Veps_{11} - \Veps_{22})^2 + (\Veps_{22} - \Veps_{33})^2 + (\Veps_{33} - \Veps_{11})^2\right] + 2(\Veps_{12}^2 + \Veps_{23}^2 + \Veps_{13}^2)\right]}
\Eeq
For volume preserving plastic deformations, $\Tr(\BVeps) = 0$, and we have
\Beq
  \Veps_\Teff = \sqrt{
     \tfrac{2}{3}\left(\Veps_{11}^2 + \Veps_{22}^2 + \Veps_{33}^2\right) + 
     \tfrac{4}{3}\left(\Veps_{12}^2 + \Veps_{23}^2 + \Veps_{13}^2\right)} 
     = \sqrt{
     \tfrac{2}{3}\left(\Veps_{11}^2 + \Veps_{22}^2 + \Veps_{33}^2\right) + 
     \tfrac{1}{3}\left(\gamma_{12}^2 + \gamma_{23}^2 + \gamma_{13}^2\right)} \,.
\Eeq

\subsection{Equivalent strain rate and plastic strain}
The equivalent strain rate is defined as
\Beq \label{eq:eq_strain_rate}
  \dot{\Veps}^\Teq = \sqrt{\dot{\BVeps}:\dot{\BVeps}} 
\Eeq
where $\dot{\BVeps}(t)$ is the strain rate tensor.  The distortional equivalent strain rate is
\Beq \label{eq:eq_shear_strain_rate}
  \dot{\gamma}^\Teq = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}\dot{\BVeps}_s:\dot{\BVeps}_s} 
\Eeq
where $\dot{\BVeps}_s(t)$ is the deviatoric strain rate tensor.

For models where an equivalent plastic strain is computed, we define a scalar equivalent plastic
strain rate as
\Beq \label{eq:eq_plastic_strain_rate}
  \dot{\Veps}_p^\Teq = \sqrt{\dot{\BVeps}^p:\dot{\BVeps}^p} 
\Eeq
where $\dot{\BVeps}^p(t)$ is the plastic strain rate tensor.
The definition of the scalar equivalent plastic strain is
\Beq \label{eq:eq_plastic_strain}
  \Veps_p^\Teq(t) = \int_0^t \dot{\Veps}_p^\Teq(\tau) d\tau \,.
\Eeq
The corresponding distortional equivalent plastic strain rate and strain are defined as
\Beq \label{eq:eq_plastic_shear_strain_rate}
  \dot{\gamma}_p^\Teq = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}\dot{\BVeps}_s^p:\dot{\BVeps}_s^p} 
\Eeq
and
\Beq \label{eq:eq_plastic_shear_strain}
  \gamma_p^\Teq(t) = \int_0^t \dot{\gamma}_p^\Teq(\tau) d\tau \,.
\Eeq

\subsection{Velocity gradient, rate-of-deformation, deformation gradient}
The velocity gradient is represented by $\BlT$ and the defromation gradient by $\BF$.  The
rate-of-deformation is
\Beq
  \BdT = \Half(\BlT + \BlT^T) = \Half(\Grad{\Bv} + \Grad{\Bv}^T) \,.
\Eeq

\subsection{Eigenvectors and coordinate transformations}
For most situations, tensor components in \Vaango are expressed in terms of the basis vectors
$\Be_1 = (1,0,0)$, $\Be_2 = (0,1,0)$, and $\Be_3 = (0,0,1)$.  However, in some situations
tensor components have to be expressed in the eigenbasis of a second-order tensor.
Let these eigenvectors be $\Bv_1$, $\Bv_2$ and $\Bv_3$.  Then a vector $\Ba$
with components $(a_1, a_2, a_2)$ in the original basis has components $(a_1', a_2', a_3')$ in
the eigenbasis.  The two sets of components are related by
\Beq
  \begin{bmatrix} a_1' \\ a_2' \\a_3' \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix} 
    \Be_1\cdot\Bv_1 & \Be_2\cdot\Bv_1 & \Be_3 \cdot \Bv_1 \\
    \Be_1\cdot\Bv_2 & \Be_2\cdot\Bv_2 & \Be_3 \cdot \Bv_2 \\
    \Be_1\cdot\Bv_3 & \Be_2\cdot\Bv_3 & \Be_3 \cdot \Bv_3 
  \end{bmatrix}  
  \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\a_3 \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix} 
    v_{11} & v_{12} & v_{13} \\
    v_{21} & v_{22} & v_{23} \\
    v_{31} & v_{32} & v_{33} 
  \end{bmatrix}  
  \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\a_3 \end{bmatrix}  = 
  \BQ \cdot \Ba \,.
\Eeq
The matrix that is used for this coordinate transformation, $\BQ$, is given by
\Beq
  \BQ^T := \begin{bmatrix} \Bv_1 & \Bv_2 & \Bv_3 \end{bmatrix}
\Eeq
where $\Bv_1$, $\Bv_2$, and $\Bv_3$ are \Textbfc{column vectors} representing the components
of the eigenvectors in the reference basis.

The above coordinate transformation for vectors can be written in index notation as
\Beq
  a'_i = Q_{ij} a_j \,.
\Eeq
For transformations of second-order tensors, we have
\Beq
  T'_{ij} = Q_{ip} Q_{jq} T_{pq} \,.
\Eeq
For fourth-order tensors, the transformation relation is
\Beq
  C'_{ijk\ell} = Q_{im} Q_{jn} Q_{kp} Q_{\ell q} C_{mnpq} \,.
\Eeq

If the second-order tensor $\BT$ is symmetric, we can express it in Mandel notation 
as a six-dimensional vector $\hat{\Bt}$:
\Beq
  \hat{\Bt} = 
    \begin{bmatrix} T_{11} & T_{22} & T_{33} & \sqrt{2} T_{23} & \sqrt{2} T_{31} & \sqrt{2} T_{12} \end{bmatrix}^T
\Eeq
Then the transformation matrix is a $6\times 6$ matrix, $\hat{\BQ}$, such that
\Beq
  \hat{t}'_{i} = \hat{Q}_{ij} \hat{t}_{j} \,.
\Eeq
The matrix $\hat{\BQ}$ has components~\cite{Mehrabadi1990},
\Beq
  \hat{\BQ} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    Q_{11}^2 & Q_{12}^2 & Q_{13}^2 & \sqrt{2} Q_{12}Q_{13} & \sqrt{2} Q_{11}Q_{13} & \sqrt{2} Q_{11}Q_{12} \\
    Q_{21}^2 & Q_{22}^2 & Q_{23}^2 & \sqrt{2} Q_{22}Q_{23} & \sqrt{2} Q_{21}Q_{23} & \sqrt{2} Q_{21}Q_{22} \\
    Q_{31}^2 & Q_{32}^2 & Q_{33}^2 & \sqrt{2} Q_{32}Q_{33} & \sqrt{2} Q_{31}Q_{33} & \sqrt{2} Q_{31}Q_{32} \\
    \sqrt{2} Q_{21}Q_{31} & \sqrt{2} Q_{22}Q_{32} & \sqrt{2} Q_{23}Q_{33} & 
    Q_{22}Q_{33} + Q_{23}Q_{32} & Q_{21}Q_{33} + Q_{31}Q_{23} & Q_{21}Q_{32} + Q_{31}Q_{22} \\
    \sqrt{2} Q_{11}Q_{31} & \sqrt{2} Q_{12}Q_{32} & \sqrt{2} Q_{13}Q_{33} & 
    Q_{12}Q_{33} + Q_{32}Q_{13} & Q_{11}Q_{33} + Q_{13}Q_{31} & Q_{11}Q_{32} + Q_{31}Q_{12} \\
    \sqrt{2} Q_{11}Q_{31} & \sqrt{2} Q_{12}Q_{22} & \sqrt{2} Q_{13}Q_{23} & 
    Q_{12}Q_{23} + Q_{22}Q_{13} & Q_{11}Q_{23} + Q_{21}Q_{13} & Q_{11}Q_{22} + Q_{21}Q_{12} 
  \end{bmatrix}
\Eeq
Similarly, the transformation relation for fourth-order tensors simplifies to
\Beq
  \hat{C}'_{ij} = \hat{Q}_{ip} \hat{Q}_{jq} \hat{C}_{pq} 
\Eeq
where 
\Beq
  \hat{\BC} = \begin{bmatrix}
         C_{1111} & C_{1122} & C_{1133} & \sqrt{2} C_{1123} & \sqrt{2} C_{1131} & \sqrt{2} C_{1112} \\
         C_{2211} & C_{2222} & C_{2233} & \sqrt{2} C_{2223} & \sqrt{2} C_{2231} & \sqrt{2} C_{2212} \\
         C_{3311} & C_{3322} & C_{3333} & \sqrt{2} C_{3323} & \sqrt{2} C_{3331} & \sqrt{2} C_{3312} \\
         \sqrt{2} C_{2311} & \sqrt{2} C_{2322} & \sqrt{2} C_{2333} & 2 C_{2323} & 2 C_{2331} & 2 C_{2312} \\
         \sqrt{2} C_{3111} & \sqrt{2} C_{3122} & \sqrt{2} C_{3133} & 2 C_{3123} & 2 C_{3131} & 2 C_{3112} \\
         \sqrt{2} C_{1211} & \sqrt{2} C_{1222} & \sqrt{2} C_{1233} & 2 C_{1223} & 2 C_{1231} & 2 C_{1212} 
         \end{bmatrix}
\Eeq
