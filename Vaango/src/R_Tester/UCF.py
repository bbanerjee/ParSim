#Performance and other UCF related tests

#  Test syntax: ( "folder name", "input file", # processors, "OS", ["flags1","flag2"])
#  flags: 
#       gpu:                    - run test if machine is gpu enabled
#       no_uda_comparison:      - skip the uda comparisons
#       no_memoryTest:          - skip all memory checks
#       no_restart:             - skip the restart tests
#       no_dbg:                 - skip all debug compilation tests
#       no_opt:                 - skip all optimized compilation tests
#       do_performance_test:    - Run the performance test, log and plot simulation runtime.
#                                 (You cannot perform uda comparsions with this flag set)
#       doesTestRun:            - Checks if a test successfully runs
#       abs_tolerance=[double]  - absolute tolerance used in comparisons
#       rel_tolerance=[double]  - relative tolerance used in comparisons
#       exactComparison         - set absolute/relative tolerance = 0  for uda comparisons
#       startFromCheckpoint     - start test from checkpoint. (/home/csafe-tester/CheckPoints/..../testname.uda.000)
#       vaango_options="string"    - Additional command line options for vaango command
#
#  Notes: 
#  1) The "folder name" must be the same as input file without the extension.
#  2) If the processors is > 1.0 then an mpirun command will be used
#  3) Performance_tests are not run on a debug build.
