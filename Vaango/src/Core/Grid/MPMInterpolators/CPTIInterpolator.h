/* Convected Particle Domain (Triangular/Tetrahedral) Interpolator

Based on the CPDI interpolator in the paper by Sadeghirad, Burghardt and Brannon
"A convected particle domain interpolation technique to extend applicability of
the material point method for problems involving massive deformations"
International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering
Volume 86, Issue 12, pages 1435â€“1456, 24 June 2011

CPTI is an extension to allow for other polygons, in this case a
triangular/tetrahedral particle domain description.

An additional feature of this implementation, not described above, is the
ability to restrict the particle domains from exceeding a user specified
length, defined here as "lcrit".  An algorithm, developed by Michael Homel and
Rebecca Brannon, is used to scale the deformed particle such that no corners
of that particle will fall outside of a sphere with radius lcrit, co-centered
with the particle.  This feature was added to avoid particles from getting
so large that they have influence with nodes that lie beyond the ghost nodes
of neighboring patches, or outside of the computational domain, as they approach
node boundaries.  Note that lcrit is a dimension relative to the cell size.
Thus, lcrit=1 implies that a particle can have no length as measured from the
center to any corner that exceeds the side length of a computational cell.
